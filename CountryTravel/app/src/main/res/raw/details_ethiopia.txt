Most visitors start their Ethiopian odyssey in the capital Addis Ababa, a lively city nestling in the lofty Entoto Mountains. Founded in 1886 by Emperor Menelik II after his wife Empress Taytu chose the site for its hot mineral springs, Addis Ababa has enjoyed a fascinating transformation over a relatively short period of time. The city is now a hub of international missions and embassies, including the headquarters of the African Union and the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). Few linger long in the Ethiopian capital, choosing instead to head north to Lalibela, a pilgrimage site famed for its ancient churches which have quite literally been hewn out of a cliff. Lalibela is one of nine UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Ethiopia. Other notables include the ancient Kingdom of Aksum (or Axum), the fairytale castle of Gondar, the walled city of Harar, the Konso cultural landscape, the prehistoric sites of Awash and Omo valleys, the mysterious stelae of Tiya and the spectacular Simien National Park where the indigenous Gelada baboon and Walia Ibex thrive.

Driving standards and vehicle maintenance are often poor and traffic accidents are a regular occurrence in Ethiopia, especially in Addis Ababa and on the Addis Ababa-Djibouti road. In Addis Ababa, it is advised to only use the metered yellow taxis as these generally have higher standards of maintenance than the blue and white taxis. Under Ethiopian law, drivers involved in car accidents can face severe punishments, including custodial sentences and fines. You should be very careful when travelling by car.

Good hotels in Ethiopia can be found in Addis Ababa and other main tourist destinations including Mekelle and Lalibela. Facilities and service tend to vary widely, although breakfast is usually included. A 10% service charge and 15% room tax is commonly charged at top-end hotels. Within Addis Ababa, Golden Tulip on Cameroon Street is a good 4-star hotel popular with business travellers and foreign visitors. Its Spice Restaurant offers an outstanding spread of buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner as well as a la carte options. Hilton and Radisson Blu are the two other hotels preferred by foreign visitors.
